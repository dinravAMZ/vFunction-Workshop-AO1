# vFunction AWS Workshop

## Introduction

vFunction is an **Architectural Observability** and **Automation** platform for architects to manage software **architectural technical debt** and enable **continuous application modernization**.

The vFunction platform has two modules:

1. **Architectural Observability (AO):** for analyzing the applications and continuously monitor and handle architectural debt and drifts

2. **Refactoring Engine (RE):** automation to **create services** corresponding to the functional domains specified in the AO module as independent software components.

### How to do this Workshop?

Start by setting up your environment by completing the **[Setup Environment](/10_setup.html)** section.

Then do the **[AO Tutorial](/100_architectural-observability.html)** - a hands-on tutorial for the Architectural Observability module

**If** you are interested extracting services corresponding to the domains specified in the AO Module, do the **[RE Tutorial](/200_refactoring-engine.html)**.

To delete the resources created in the setup, make sure to do the **[Cleanup](/300_cleanup.html)** section when you're done.

To flip pages use the right and left arrows at the sides of the main frame.

Use the left frame for content navigation and search.

### To benefit the most from this workshop, you should know:

- Basic Java (we will use Eclipse for coding).
- Basic UNIX commands.
- Basic AWS concepts.
