# Automated Application Modernization with vFunction Architectural Observability Workshop

## Introduction

Software architects lack the observability, visibility, and tooling to assess, understand, track, and manage **architectural technical debt** and accelerate application modernization. **vFunction Architectural Observability Manager (AO)** allows architects to actively engage in Agile and DevOps lifecycles from an architectural perspective to manage, monitor, and fix application architecture drift issues on an iterative, continuous basis and drive application modernization initiatives. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to identify sources of architectural technical debt and address them immediately. This includes how to automatically discover and refine domains, identify cross domain pollution, high debt classes, and cross-domain database relationships. vFunction AO will help you establish a baseline architecture, alert, and build a prescriptive to-do list of architectural drift issues such as new service detected, new common classes found, service exclusivity change, new dead code found, and new high debt classes identified. 

The vFunction platform has two modules:

1. **Architectural Observability (AO):** for analyzing the applications and continuously monitor and handle architectural debt and drifts

2. **Refactoring Engine (RE):** automation to **create services** corresponding to the functional domains specified in the AO module as independent software components. A seperate workshop is available for Refactoring Engine. 

### How to do this Workshop?

Start by setting up your environment by completing the **[Setup Environment](/10_setup.html)** section.

Then complete the **[AO Tutorial](/100_architectural-observability.html)** - a hands-on tutorial for the Architectural Observability module

**If** you are interested extracting services corresponding to the domains specified in the AO Module, you can complete the **[RE Tutorial](https://awsworkshop.io/)**.

To delete the resources created in the setup, make sure to do the **[Cleanup](/300_cleanup.html)** section when you're done.

### To benefit the most from this workshop, you should know:

- Basic Java (we will use Eclipse for coding).
- Basic UNIX commands.
- Basic AWS concepts.

The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how vFunction and various AWS services can be architected to build a solution, while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.
