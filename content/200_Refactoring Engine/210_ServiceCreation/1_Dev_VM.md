### Dev VM Content


1. Connect to Windows VM (credentials are workshop/vFunction2021!)

2. Open Windows Explorer and see the folder structure under C:\vFunctionLab. Most of the work in the section is done in this folder as described here:

The folder c:\vFunctionLab\oms-tutorial\oms-services can be used as a reference to resolve any compilation or runtime issues encountered during this phase. You can compare your code with the code in that folder using WinDiff.
