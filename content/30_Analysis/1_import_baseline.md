### Importing the starting point measurement

Every measurement may have different results following the Learning Phase, depending on the flows covered in the original application. Since this is a step-by-step tutorial, it is recommended to start by importing the measurement used for the analysis steps in this tutorial.

1. Go to the vFunction Server Web UI

2. Switch to the Analysis page and click IMPORT (bottom of the pane) and then CHOOSE FILE in the popup dialog

3. In the Open file dialog, select **C:\vFunctionLab\measurements\Analysis-Tutorial-Start.zip** and click Open

4. Click IMPORT

    The initial measurement should load after a few seconds.
