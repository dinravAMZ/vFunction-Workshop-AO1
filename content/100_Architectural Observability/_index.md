This is a hands-on tutorial for the vFunction Architectural Observability (AO) module. 

We will use the Order Management System (OMS) demo application to show how to collect, analyze, gain insights as well as monitor and handle architectural debt and architectural drifts of an application.


### Learning Objectives

- How to collect data for architectural observability
- How to identify and address architectural tech debt
- How to define and baseline domains for the application
- How to continuously monitor and address architectural drifts

### Workshop Flow

The following flowchart describes the tutorial steps and artifacts of this tutorial. 

The rounded rectangles represent steps you'll perform (with time estimation), the parallelograms represent artifacts / results (some can be downloaded) and the trapezoid represent an event.
