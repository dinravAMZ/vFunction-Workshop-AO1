### Importing the starting point measurement

Every measurement may have different results following the Learning Phase, depending on the flows covered in the original application. Since this is a step-by-step tutorial, it is recommended to start by importing the measurement used for the analysis steps in this tutorial.

1. Go to the vFunction Server Web UI

2. Switch to the Analysis page 

3. Click MEASUREMENTS (bottom of the pane), select IMPORT MEASUREMENT and then CHOOSE FILE in the popup dialog

4. In the Open file dialog, select **C:\vFunctionLab\measurements\Analysis-Tutorial-Start.zip** and click Open

5. Click IMPORT

    The initial measurement should load after a few seconds.

6. Click on the bell shaped icon at the top of the page to see the notifications - you should have a notification that the learning results include beans and database tables.

7. Click *Configure Parameters* under ACTIONS in the left pane, and ensure the checkmark *Enable Auto Refactoring* is checked (turned on)
