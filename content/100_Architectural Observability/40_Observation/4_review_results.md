### Review scheduled learning and anlysis results

1. Go to the vFunction Web UI and switch to the analysis page

2. From the MEASUREMENT menu (bottom of page) SELECT the Scheduled measurement

3. Click on the Bell icon at the top of the page to see the notifications - it should look like the following:

    ![Notifications](/images/notifications.png)

4. Let's review the notifications:

    - Notification that the scheduled learning was done and the data was sent to analysis
    - A new class was introduced to the common library: com.oms.entity.Customer
    - A new CustomerController domain was added

5. Since we have a new domain that was introduced (which is correct) can proceed and review the analysis and set the new measurement as a new baseline.


6. Rename the measurement as Baseline 2 and then mark Baseline 2 as the main measurement via the SELECT MEASUREMENT menu. You can optionally clean all notifications. 

7. Switch to the Observation page and change Baseline 2 to become new baseline measurement
