## Description

Software architects lack the observability, visibility, and tooling to assess, understand, track, and manage **architectural technical debt** and accelerate application modernization. **vFunction Architectural Observability Manager (AO)** allows architects to actively engage in Agile and DevOps lifecycles from an architectural perspective to manage, monitor, and fix application architecture drift issues on an iterative, continuous basis and drive application modernization initiatives. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to identify sources of architectural technical debt and address them immediately. This includes how to automatically discover and refine domains, identify cross domain pollution, high debt classes, and cross-domain database relationships. vFunction AO will help you establish a baseline architecture, alert, and build a prescriptive to-do list of architectural drift issues such as new service detected, new common classes found, service exclusivity change, new dead code found, and new high debt classes identified.
